The Potato Pages

The Potato Pages is an independent journal created for a place to publish and review articles that do not fit in elsewhere. The general tone of the articles is professional with and underlying content of absurdity. Anyone is welcome to submit an article through our review process and have a chance for their article to be published in the upcoming Potato Pages. Each article will undergo a peer review process and returned to the submitter for correction until the articles are appropriate for publication. Topics for the Potato Page articles are free to be anything with a single caveat, it must begin with "consider a potato."

It is important to note that in the botanical sciences, a potato is a tuber. Thus, we can ask, “tuber or not tuber, that is the question.”
