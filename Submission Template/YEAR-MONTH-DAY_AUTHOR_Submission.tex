	I. Introduction
\end{center}

Consider a Potato. Thoroughly consider this potato. Adapt this potato to the topic at hand. Feel the potato. Be the potato \cite{scroll}.

\begin{center}
	II. Methodology
\end{center}

If we take a theoretical potato, we can show that one can construct an infinite number of multidimensional shapes. First, from a $4\pi$ topological point of view, take the cross section of said potato with the largest diameter $d$ in all possible rotation frames. The resulting selection should form a perfect sphere. Neglect the volume of potato that exists outside of this chosen sphere. Then, extrude this sphere such that it is $n$-dimensional \cite{n}.

We can now take any $n$-dimensional shape. Observe this shape as a cross section from any angle in all of the $n$-dimensions. Now, take the longest distance that can be created by the length of one of these cross sections $d_c$. We can then scale down this new shape such that the longest cross section will fit within our potato, which would be scaling the shape by a factor of $\frac{d}{d_c}$. Therefore, our shape can be contained within our $n$-dimensional potato. Finally, by shaving away all parts within our potato that do not mirror a part in our shape, we can construct any shape from our potato.

\begin{center}
	III. Proof
\end{center}

The proof of this is trivial. Just biject it to a simplicial topological space whose elements are skew-symmetric bijections \cite{proof}.

\begin{center}
	III. Conclusion
\end{center}

By use of sophisticated algorithms, we've made a meaningless meaningful conclusion to enlighten the world based on that majestic potato.
